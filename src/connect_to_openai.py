    - Music Genre: A string representing the music genre (e.g., 'pop', 'rock').
    - Mood: A string indicating the mood of the music (e.g., 'happy', 'energetic'). - Optional
    - Year Range: A string representing the range of years for the music (e.g., '2010-2020') - Optional

    Based on these user input parameters, determine the appropriate values for the following Spotify API parameters, provide only these parameters: 
    - seed_artists (comma-separated string of artists' names, not artist id) provide exactly 2 existing artists.
    - seed_tracks (comma-separated string of track names and their artist, not track id. e.g: "Let It Be - The Beatles,Shape of You - Ed Sheeran")
   THE SEED TRACKS MUST NOT BE BY THE SAME ARTISTS YOU GIVE AS THE SEED ARTISTS, but they should still fit the user input parameters. make sure to provide exactly 2 tracks.
    MAKE SURE TO FIT THOSE ARTISTS TO THE REQUESTED MUSIC GENRE AND THE EVENT, AS WELL AS THE AUDIENCE AGE AND YEAR RANGE.
    Moreover, make sure to fit the next parameters I will tell you in the same way.
    - min_acousticness, max_acousticness, target_acousticness (float, range: 0-1)
    - min_danceability, max_danceability, target_danceability (float, range: 0-1)
    - min_energy, max_energy, target_energy (float, range: 0-1)
    - min_instrumentalness, max_instrumentalness, target_instrumentalness (float, range: 0-1)
    - min_liveness, max_liveness, target_liveness (float, range: 0-1)
    
    The values for the Spotify API parameters should be derived based on the given user input parameters, taking into account the characteristics of the event, music genre, audience age range, and year range.
    Make sure not to choose extreme values for the parameters, and try to keep them within a reasonable range based on the user input.
    Output the result as a JSON object and nothing else."""
